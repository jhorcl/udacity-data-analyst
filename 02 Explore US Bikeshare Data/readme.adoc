== Project Overview

In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike
share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York
City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer
interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will
also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience
in the terminal to present these statistics.

=== What Software Do I Need?

To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:

- You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
- A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

== Project Details

=== Bike Share Data

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and
popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to
rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to
borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also
return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride.
Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the
system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These
technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how
these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will use data provided by
https://www.motivateco.com/[Motivate], a bike share system
provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share
usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities:
Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

=== The Datasets

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all
three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6)
columns:

- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

- Gender
- Birth Year

The original files are much larger and messier, and you don't need to download
them, but they can be accessed here if you'd like to see them
(https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data[Chicago],
https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data[New York City],
https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data[Washington]).
These files had more columns and they differed in format in many cases. Some
data wrangling has been performed to condense these files to the above core six
columns to make your analysis and the evaluation of your Python skills more
straightforward. In the Data Wrangling course that comes later in the Data
Analyst Nanodegree program, students learn how to wrangle the dirtiest,
messiest datasets, so don't worry, you won't miss out on learning this
important skill!

=== Statistics Computed

You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington
by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write
code to provide the following information:

*1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)*

- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

*2 Popular stations and trip*

- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

*3 Trip duration*

- total travel time
- average travel time

*4 User info*

- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

=== The Files

To answer these questions using Python, you will need to write a Python script.
To help guide your work in this project, a template with helper code and
comments is provided in a bikeshare.py file, and you will do your scripting in
there also. You will need the three city dataset files too:

- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

All four of these files are zipped up in the Bikeshare file in the resource
tab in the sidebar on the left side of this page. You may download and open
up that zip file to do your project work on your local machine.

Some versions of this project also include a Project Workspace page in the
classroom where the bikeshare.py file and the city dataset files are all
included, and you can do all your work with them there.

=== An Interactive Experience

The bikeshare.py file is set up as a script that takes in raw input to create
an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the
dataset. The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input,
the answers to the questions on the previous page will change! There are four
questions that will change the answers:

- Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
- Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
- (If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
- (If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

The answers to the questions above will determine the city and timeframe on
which you'll do data analysis. After filtering the dataset, users will see the
statistical result of the data, and choose to start again or exit.

Remember that any time you ask users for input, there is a chance they may not
enter what you expect, so your code should handle unexpected input well without
failing. You need to anticipate raw input errors like typos, or users
misunderstanding what you are expecting. Use the tips provided in the sections
of the Scripting lesson in this course to make sure your code does not fail
with an execution error due to unexpected raw input.

*Note that this bikeshare.py file is simply a template you can use, but you are
not required to use it.* You can change the functions however you like as long
as you have an ending product that meets the project requirements. Changes to
the structure of bikeshare.py (e.g., adding and/or deleting helper functions)
that you think make the code more efficient or have a better style are
encouraged!

==  Practice Problem 1

Use pandas to load chicago.csv into a dataframe, and find the most frequent hour
when people start traveling. There isn't an hour column in this dataset, but
you can create one by extracting the hour from the "Start Time" column. To do
this, you can convert "Start Time" to the datetime datatype using the pandas
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.to_datetime.html[to_datetime()]
method and extracting properties such as the hour with these
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#datetimelike-properties[properties].

_Hint: Another way to describe the most common value in a column is the mode._

[source, python]
----
import pandas as pd

filename = 'chicago.csv'

# load data file into a dataframe
df = pd.read_csv(filename)

# convert the Start Time column to datetime
df['Start Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Start Time'])

# extract hour from the Start Time column to create an hour column
df['hour'] = df['Start Time'].dt.hour

# find the most popular hour
popular_hour = df['hour'].mode()[0]

print('Most Popular Start Hour:', popular_hour)
----

== Practice Problem 2

There are different types of users specified in the "User Type" column. Find
how many there are of each type and store the counts in a pandas Series in
the user_types variable.

_Hint: What pandas function returns a Series with the counts of each unique
value in a column?_

[source, python]
----
import pandas as pd

filename = 'chicago.csv'

# load data file into a dataframe
df = pd.read_csv(filename)

# print value counts for each user type
user_types = df['User Type'].value_counts()

print(user_types)
----

== Practice Problem 3

This is a bit of a bigger task, which involves choosing a dataset to load and
filtering it based on a specified month and day. In the quiz below, you'll
implement the load_data() function, which you can use directly in your project.
There are four steps:

1. *Load the dataset for the specified city.* Index the global *_CITY_DATA_*
dictionary object to get the corresponding filename for the given city name.
2. *Create _month_ and _day_of_week_ columns.* Convert the "Start Time" column
to datetime and extract the month number and weekday name into separate columns
using the datetime module.
3. *Filter by month.* Since the *_month_* parameter is given as the name of
the month, you'll need to first convert this to the corresponding month number.
Then, select rows of the dataframe that have the specified month and reassign
this as the new dataframe.
4. *Filter by day of week.* Select rows of the dataframe that have the specified
day of week and reassign this as the new dataframe. (Note: Capitalize the day
parameter with the title() method to match the title case used in the
day_of_week column!)

[source, python]
----
import pandas as pd

CITY_DATA = { 'chicago': 'chicago.csv',
              'new york city': 'new_york_city.csv',
              'washington': 'washington.csv' }

def load_data(city, month, day):
    """
    Loads data for the specified city and filters by month and day if applicable.

    Args:
        (str) city - name of the city to analyze
        (str) month - name of the month to filter by, or "all" to apply no month filter
        (str) day - name of the day of week to filter by, or "all" to apply no day filter
    Returns:
        df - Pandas DataFrame containing city data filtered by month and day
    """

    # load data file into a dataframe
    df = pd.read_csv(CITY_DATA[city])

    # convert the Start Time column to datetime
    df['Start Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Start Time'])

    # extract month and day of week from Start Time to create new columns
    df['month'] = df['Start Time'].dt.month
    df['day_of_week'] = df['Start Time'].dt.weekday_name

    # filter by month if applicable
    if month != 'all':
        # use the index of the months list to get the corresponding int
        months = ['january', 'february', 'march', 'april', 'may', 'june']
        month = months.index(month) + 1

        # filter by month to create the new dataframe
        df = df[df['month'] == month]

    # filter by day of week if applicable
    if day != 'all':
        # filter by day of week to create the new dataframe
        df = df[df['day_of_week'] == day.title()]

    return df

== Comments

I did the following to write my solution:

I decided not to use the provided template because I wanted to stay open
minded about how I want to present the interactive part of my solution. First
I wrote the complete interactive part without analyzing any data. My idea was
to present option lists to the user which only contain numbers. This is to
avoid checking type errors. (My career started on the Mainframe ...)

As I wrote a lot of scripts in Perl in the past I favor having all mutatable
variables in a hash - what is a Dictionary in Python. So I implemented the
primary data structures as a tuple of dictionaries (the city_data) and the
options the user has (options dictionary).

In addition I like functional programming.
So I implemented the interactive part by
returning a function from the menu functions. The functions to get user
input are implemented as nested functions of the main menu function. In
addition the time a calculation took is calculated by passing functions to
a function that executes the calculations and measures the time difference.

After finishing the menu "mockup" I implemented all functions to calculate
the statistics requested. In addition I added some more statistics - for
example using the gender data.

Last but not least I implemented a non-interactive part to automatically test
all variations and to let the user analyze data from the command line. This is
done using argparse and a test function.

Websites used:
To learn about what I needed to implement this I mostly used the Python and
Pandas documention on the internet. In addition I only used Stack Overflow.

Books used:
I began reading 'Think Stats' by 'Allen B. Downey'.
