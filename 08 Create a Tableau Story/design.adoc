=== Initial Design

As PISA contains data of a lot of countries around the world I first thought about creating maps.
But as I want to show a relationship between Countries and ICT availability, usage and scores I switched to bar charts and scatterplots.

For readability I choosed to use the color palette for color blinded and decided to use grey colors for the first bar charts.
In addition I choosed to stay with the default fonts provided by Tableau.
The trend lines were colored orange for contrast.
The third bar chart does include more categories for the usage of ICT at school so I included more colors of the color blinded palette.
As the scatter plots contain all countries there were not enough colors in the palette for this categories.
Hence I used an automatic palette.
Overall I like to use light colors and white.
Hence I used that.

As the countries include OECD and Non-OECD countries I added a filter and a highlighter for these two groups.
In addition on the third chart I included a filter for the time categories ICT is used at school.

On all plots I included the averages to better see the message I want to transport.

=== Changes from Feedback of 3rd of November

* I decided to rotate the bar charts to get horizontal bars so that the country names are better readable.
* In addition I remove the dual axis to split the plot in two different bar charts.
  This is to be able to compare the countries even better.

=== Changes after initial version by me

* I decided to remove the filter about OECD and Non-OECD Countries because this information is not needed for the message I'd like to transport.
* I removed the tick marks on the bar charts because the values of the bars were shown already.
  Hence I think that this is redundant information.
* I removed the story title from the header to get a higher data ink ratio.
* I changed the size of the Story to `Generic Desktop` to remove the borders around the slide.

=== Changes from Feedback of 4th of November

* Added the datasource link and a short sentence about it on the first slide.
* Removed colours of data points in the scatter plots as the points do have a label.
