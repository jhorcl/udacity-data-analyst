== Summary

PISA is a worldwide study developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which examines the skills of 15-year-old school students around the world.
The study assesses students’ mathematics, science, and reading skills and contains a wealth of information on students’ background, their school and the organisation of education systems.
The visualizations created in this project show the relation between the scores of the students and their usage of Information and Communication Technologies at School.
Does it matter whether students do have access to these new technologies at school?
