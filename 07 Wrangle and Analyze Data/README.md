# T2P3 Wrangle and Analyze Data

## Summary

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because ["they're good dogs Brent."](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent) WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs [downloaded their Twitter archive](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170160) and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.

## What Software Do I Need?

The entirety of this project can be completed inside the Udacity classroom on the Project Workspace: Complete and Submit Project page using the Jupyter Notebook provided there. (Note: This Project Workspace may not be available in all versions of this project, in which case you should follow the directions below.)

If you want to work outside of the Udacity classroom, the following software requirements apply:


+ You need to be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook on your computer. Please revisit our Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda tutorials earlier in the Nanodegree program for installation instructions.
+ The following packages (libraries) need to be installed. You can install these packages via conda or pip. Please revisit our Anaconda tutorial earlier in the Nanodegree program for package installation instructions.
    - pandas
    - NumPy
    - requests
    - tweepy
    - json
+ You need to be able to create written documents that contain images and you need to be able to export these documents as PDF files. This task can be done in a Jupyter Notebook, but you might prefer to use a word processor like Google Docs, which is free, or Microsoft Word.
+ A text editor, like Sublime, which is free, will be useful but is not required.

## Project Motivation

### Context

Your goal: wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for *"Wow!"*-worthy analyses and visualizations.

### The Data

#### Enhanced Twitter Archive

The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog "stage" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive "enhanced." Of the 5000+ tweets, I have filtered for tweets with ratings only (there are 2356).

I extracted this data programmatically, but I didn't do a very good job. The ratings probably aren't all correct. Same goes for the dog names and probably dog stages (see below for more information on these) too. You'll need to assess and clean these columns if you want to use them for analysis and visualization.

#### Additional Data via the Twitter API

Back to the basic-ness of Twitter archives: retweet count and favorite count are two of the notable column omissions. Fortunately, this additional data can be gathered by anyone from Twitter's API. Well, "anyone" who has access to data for the 3000 most recent tweets, at least. But you, because you have the WeRateDogs Twitter archive and specifically the tweet IDs within it, can gather this data for all 5000+. And guess what? You're going to query Twitter's API to gather this valuable data.

#### Image Predictions File

One more cool thing: I ran every image in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive through a [neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Ol7ZB0MmU) that can classify breeds of dogs. The results: a table full of image predictions (the top three only) alongside each tweet ID, image URL, and the image number that corresponded to the most confident prediction (numbered 1 to 4 since tweets can have up to four images).

+ tweet_id is the last part of the tweet URL after "status/"
+ p1 is the algorithm's #1 prediction for the image in the tweet
+ p1_conf is how confident the algorithm is in its #1 prediction
+ p1_dog is whether or not the #1 prediction is a breed of dog
+ p2 is the algorithm's second most likely prediction
+ p2_conf is how confident the algorithm is in its #2 prediction
+ p2_dog is whether or not the #2 prediction is a breed of dog

So that's all fun and good. But all of this additional data will need to be gathered, assessed, and cleaned. This is where you come in.

### Key Points

Key points to keep in mind when data wrangling for this project:

+ You only want original ratings (no retweets) that have images. Though there are 5000+ tweets in the dataset, not all are dog ratings and some are retweets.
+ Assessing and cleaning the entire dataset completely would require a lot of time, and is not necessary to practice and demonstrate your skills in data wrangling. Therefore, the requirements of this project are only to assess and clean at least 8 quality issues and at least 2 tidiness issues in this dataset.
+ Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of [tidy data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html).
+ The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This [unique rating system](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent) is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.
+ You do not need to gather the tweets beyond August 1st, 2017. You can, but note that you won't be able to gather the image predictions for these tweets since you don't have access to the algorithm used.

## Gathering Data for this Project

Gather each of the three pieces of data as described below in a Jupyter Notebook titled wrangle_act.ipynb:

1. The WeRateDogs Twitter archive. I am giving this file to you, so imagine it as a file on hand. Download this file manually by clicking the following link: `twitter_archive_enhanced.csv`
2. The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file (image_predictions.tsv) is hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and the following URL: `https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv`
3. Each tweet's retweet count and favorite ("like") count at minimum, and any additional data you find interesting. Using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called tweet_json.txt file. Each tweet's JSON data should be written to its own line. Then read this .txt file line by line into a pandas DataFrame with (at minimum) tweet ID, retweet count, and favorite count. **Note: do not include your Twitter API keys, secrets, and tokens in your project submission.**

## Assessing Data for this Project

After gathering each of the above pieces of data, assess them visually and programmatically for quality and tidiness issues. Detect and document at least eight (8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues in your `wrangle_act.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. To meet specifications, the issues that satisfy the Project Motivation (see the Key Points header on the previous page) must be assessed.

## Cleaning Data for this Project

Clean each of the issues you documented while assessing. Perform this cleaning in `wrangle_act.ipynb` as well. The result should be a high quality and tidy master pandas DataFrame (or DataFrames, if appropriate). Again, the issues that satisfy the Project Motivation must be cleaned.

## Storing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Data for this Project

Store the clean DataFrame(s) in a CSV file with the main one named `twitter_archive_master.csv`. If additional files exist because multiple tables are required for tidiness, name these files appropriately. Additionally, you may store the cleaned data in a SQLite database (which is to be submitted as well if you do).

Analyze and visualize your wrangled data in your `wrangle_act.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. At least **three (3) insights and one (1) visualization** must be produced.

## Reporting for this Project

Create a **300-600 word written report** called `wrangle_report.pdf` or `wrangle_report.html` that briefly describes your wrangling efforts. This is to be framed as an internal document.

Create a **250-word-minimum written report** called `act_report.pdf` or `act_report.html` that communicates the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from your wrangled data. This is to be framed as an external document, like a blog post or magazine article, for example.

Both of these documents can be created in separate Jupyter Notebooks using the [Markdown functionality](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html) of Jupyter Notebooks, then downloading those notebooks as PDF files or HTML files (see image below). You might prefer to use a word processor like Google Docs or Microsoft Word, however.
